# GutFeeling Knowledgebase
GutFeeling Knowledgebase (GFKB) is a reference database of healthy human gut microbiome.

GFKB is generated by a metagenomic analysis pipeline describes in our paper (doi: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206484">10.1371/journal.pone.0206484</a>), and includes three tools which are integrated in the HIVE platform. 49 healthy samples sequenced at GWU and 49 healthy samples taken from The Human Microbiome Project were analysed to create the GFKB.

The contents of this repository make up the GutFeeling KnowledgeBase website, as well as the available files to download.

GFKB is apart of the Gut Microbiome Analytic System Project of HIVE Lab GW.
